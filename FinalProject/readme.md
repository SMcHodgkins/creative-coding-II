Where my coding lives


Worked on creating a temporary version using the process we used in assignment 6, though I don't really feel like this is teaching me anything new.

After learning about Unity in class I might test something in there, but I don't know how much coding is involved with that and coding that I've learned at that.

After learning about Phaser in WebDev and you mentioning it during my presentation in class I'm going to try and create something in there.

Not the biggest fan of Phaser, switching back to Unity.

Decided to commit to learning to make a simple 2D platformer in Unity using free assets.

I've had to look a ton of stuff up on how to do most everything, I'm honestly surprised that C# doesn't seem as daunting as it did before I took this class. Don't get me wrong, I feel like I'm a fish out of water but before it seemed impossible. Now that I understand the framework of programing I feel like I can kind of figure it out, or at least troubleshoot it when it isn't working.

Surprisingly motivating to get the small stuff done. Even with the internet holding my hand.

Lots of me misspelling words and encountering errors. I'm super  grateful for the Animator in Unity showing me what state I'm in. I was trying to figure out if my guy was actually going into the Jumping state and he was, I just forgot to link it from the Run and idle state which caused so many issues. Being able to visually look at the animator saved my life.
