# Homework 4
---
I had an extra space in my .txt file and it stopped everything from working. It took me so long to figure out why it was loading everything in but not animating.

Struggled with undefined widths not realizing that I didn't reset the animations if they hit or exceeded the max width.

Couldn't get the class working the way I intended.
