## TinkerCad Summary

TinkerCad by Autodesk is a collection of software tools that allow for testing and prototyping Arduino circuits. This virtual environment circuit creation is a much quicker way to test and create circuits before actually putting wires on the breadboard. Additionally, it's much easier to select the correct resistors. Aside from Arduino virtualization, Tinkercad also features simple Codeblocks that help teach early code concepts in a visual manner. Finally TinkerCad has 3D Design functionality where the user can create 3D objects and export them for use in external programs.
