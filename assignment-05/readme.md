# Homework 5
---
I was able to create a class for the objects but I couldn't get the collideRectRect to work from inside the class. I'm also having issues getting multiple hit detections to work.
    ---Added an additional hit variable which solved this issue.

Hitboxes are still too large. I'd have to go through and trim down the size of the images, but I think this functions for the purposes of the project.
