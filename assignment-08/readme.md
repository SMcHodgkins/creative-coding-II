Assignment 8
---
I was able to get three of the 4 sounds working and could also get the 4th going but only with an incredibly wide range. I probably had a resistor set too high or just set the code range incorrectly. I got three lights working but in the video I had moved my ground over to test that two would still work and forgot about it. Overall I think I just needed to put more time into this project, but I figured it would be better to turn in something rather than nothing.
